## Warning
This is in its very early stages. Don't think that it can actually do anything interesting yet. 

## Dev setup

For Mac/Linux. I've never run this on Windows, though I believe all of the tools are supported. 

1. Install Node and npm, if you haven't already.
2. Install bower if you haven't already: `npm install bower --global`
3. Run `bower install` to fetch dependencies.
4. Run the bash script `copy_dependencies` which will move only the needed files into the appropriate directory.
5. Open index.html in a browser and marvel at the fact that there is nothing there yet.
